# Pyro Examples
All files in this directory must be run with the equivalent version of Pyro (e.g. the examples in `dev` must be run with the [`dev`](https://github.com/uber/pyro#installing-pyro-dev-branch) version of Pyro).  If you are using the release version of Pyro, you will need to run the corresponding [release version](https://github.com/uber/pyro/releases) of the examples.  Note that you will need the `extras` dependencies to run the examples.
